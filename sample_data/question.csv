13,1234,0,0,"Why are not reproducible/typo flags listed under ""needs improvement""?","When you flag a question that was caused by a simple typo mistake, the option is listed under ""needs improvement"" which says:

""This question needs updates from the author in order to be answered well or belongs on another Stack Exchange site.""

However, typo mistakes which are the root cause of an entire question cannot be edited to improve said question, and the only course of action is to either close/delete it.

So, why is the option for ""Not reproducible or was caused by a typo"" listed under the ""needs improvement"" section? Shouldn't it simply be in the initial prompt window as it's own category?

And while were at it roasting the flagging prompt:

Why is duplicate listed on the initial flag prompt and also in the needs improvement section?
Why does clicking the duplicate option on the initial prompt and then clicking the back button take you to the needs improvement section? Back implies it will take you to the previous menu you were at.
Why do the initial flag prompt's options start in lower case and the needs improvment options start in upper case?",cdcdcdcd2_.png

What defines 'waterproof' is being able to submerge an apparel into water and on the inside it being dry. Trousers, boots and gaiters all made of Gore-Tex which are labelled as being waterproof should in theory block out all water from the feet to waist if they are interlocked with one another?

If water did drop down under the gaiter, because the cuff of the trouser sits over the boot, the water should roll past over the boot? However, even though gaiters are tightly wrapped around the lace of boots, they aren't 100% completely sealed off. My question is, would water travel underneath the bottom of the gaiters?",

5,1234,0,16,Trouble decoding some special characters &#146; &#147; &#148;,"I'm trying to decode some special characters in php and can't seem to find a way to do it.

 $str = 'Thi&#146;s i""s a&#146;n e&#148;xa&#147;mple';
This just returns some dots.

$str = preg_replace_callback(""/(&#[0-9]+;)/"", function($m) {
    return mb_convert_encoding($m[1], ""UTF-8"", ""HTML-ENTITIES"");
}, $str);
Some other tests just return the same string.

$str = html_entity_decode($str, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
$str = htmlspecialchars_decode($str, ENT_QUOTES);
Anyway, I've been trying all sorts of combinations but really no idea how to convert this to UTF-8 characters.

What I'm expecting to see is this:

Thi’s i""s a’n e”xa“mple
And actually if I take this directly and use htmlentities to encode it I see different characters to begin with.

Thi&rsquo;s i&quot;s a&rsquo;n e&rdquo;xa&ldquo;mple
Unfortunately I don't have control of the source and I'm stuck dealing with those characters.

Are they non standard, do I need to replace them manually with my own lookup table?

EDIT

Looking at this table here: https://brajeshwar.github.io/entities/

I see the characters I'm looking after are not listed. When I test a few characters from this table they decode just fine. I guess the list in php is incomplete by default?",
